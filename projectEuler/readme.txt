This is a list of problems I faced while solving the Project Euler problems.

1. Problem 11 : Didn't think of the reverse diagonal possibility.
2. Problem 19 : Still thinking of best way to solve.
3. Problem 26 : Stil thinking.
4. Problem 29 : Still thinking.
5. Problem 30 : Still thinking..
6. Problem 31 : The straight forward DP solution didn't strike me as soon as I would have liked.
7. Problem 45 : <int> to <long long>, copied code from previous solution leading to complications. Took a lot of time debugging when I finally realised, this is the problem.
